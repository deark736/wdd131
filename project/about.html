                <h3>Why We Started</h3>
                <p>Wanderlust Chronicles was born out of a love for travel and a desire to share that passion with the
                    world. We noticed that many travel guides lacked personal experiences and practical tips, so we set
                    out to create a platform that combines both. Our goal is to make travel accessible and enjoyable for
                    everyone, regardless of their experience level.</p>
